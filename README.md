# liquidpy

Utilities for calculations with simple liquids.

Currently, it features equations to the liquid and vapor equation of states for the monoatomic Lennard-Jones model, with methods to compute and plot the binodal with three apporoaches:

* the Percus-Yevick approximation
* the Carnahan-Starling approximation
* the Kolafa-Nezbevda equation of state
